    aboutMe:
        "I'm Sameer Narendran, a second-year student at the University of \
        Wisconsin Madison studying Computer Science and Math. My primary \
        interest is in AI and neural networks, but I also enjoy working on \
        software projects in Java as well as full-stack applications. When I'm \
        not in class or on my computer, I can usually be found reading science \
        fiction novels or playing tennis outside with my friends.",
